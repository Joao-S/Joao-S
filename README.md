##### The Gist

I am in a romantic relationship with videogames since my Godfather gifted me his MegaDrive with Sonic the Hedgehog. I was 5.
However, I ended up betraying videogames by graduating as Naval Engineer (MoS) and working as a Project Manager at a shipyard close to Lisbon, Portugal.
In March 2021 I decided to follow my passion, seek videogame's forgiveness and give this relationship a chance.
I've been taking courses and applying for jobs in videogames ever since, in my search for redemption.
